# Motion-enhanced-Holography

We proposed a novel architecture, motion-enhanced holography, that achieves realistic 3D holographic display without speckle by continuously translating the same hologram. We introduced an algorithm to generate motion-enhanced holograms and demonstrated that our method achieved a 10 dB improvement in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of focal stacks in numerical simulations compared to conventional holographic systems. Furthermore, we validated this idea in optical experiments using a high-speed and high-precision programmable three-axis displacement stage to display full-color and high-quality 3D focal stacks.
